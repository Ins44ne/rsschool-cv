## About Me

I am used to acting independently, although I enjoy working in a team, I prefer constructive, intellectual discussions with colleagues. I like having longer timelines, where I can plan my work to ensure the desired outcome, and I work best when there are clear and detailed instructions. Respect among colleagues is very important to me.
